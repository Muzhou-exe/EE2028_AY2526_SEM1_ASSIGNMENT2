# EE2028_AY2526_SEM1_ASSIGNMENT2
An embedded system developed on an STM32 development board, integrating multiple sensors, an I2C-based OLED display, and WiFi communication. The system collects sensor data, processes it on the microcontroller, and provides real-time visual feedback through the display. Wifi Connection enabled
## Software Components
- Embedded firmware developed in C on STM32 for sensor data acquisition, display control, and WiFi communication
- Python-based server for handling data exchange and system-level communication
- Python application for higher-level interaction, data processing, or visualization
- ## Features
- Embedded sensor data acquisition and processing on STM32
- I2C-based OLED display output
- WiFi communication between embedded device and host system
- Python-based server for data handling and communication
- Application-level software for system interaction and data processing
